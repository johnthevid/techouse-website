# Current handoff

Updated: 4 November 2026.

## Current state

- Original baseline: Stable Build 1 — Final, Code Reviewed, approved 3 November 2026. Archive/checksum identity is in releases/stable-build-1.json. The archive remains local and is excluded from Git.
- Working source includes later Cloudflare routing, font/image/cache loading improvements and desktop banner layout containment.
- Live Worker: techouse at https://techouse.johndavidceasar.workers.dev.
- Latest deployed version: 9be19ffd-8de2-4e61-b43c-ca5e9f7ac46f.
- Last website validation: 12 regression groups passed; 13 hover layout comparisons passed; five live pointer activations and exit behavior passed. No animation source/timing changes were made.
- User reports substantially smoother hover. Exact user-device FPS difference has not been reproduced in automated testing.

## Active task: repository documentation

GitHub Desktop successfully pushed initial commit `30fffe5` to `johnthevid/techouse-website`; local origin/main records that push and the user confirmed the files on GitHub. The connected GitHub app still returns 404 for this repository, and terminal Git has no usable HTTPS credentials. Use the signed-in GitHub Desktop to push local commits until separate terminal authentication is configured.

Expanded README.md with verified features, limitations, local setup, dependencies, deployment, cross-device workflow and recovery. Added CHANGELOG.md, RELEASES.md and GITHUB_ABOUT.md. No GitHub version tags, GitHub Releases, published packages or automatic deployment have been created. GitHub About metadata is prepared as text and still needs applying in the repository sidebar.

The current working source is newer than the original stable archive. Preserve this distinction when creating commits or release tags. This documentation update changes no website behavior and requires no Cloudflare deployment.

## Limits and private state

Hosted D1 content stays on Cloudflare. Local databases, authentication keys, OAuth configuration, contracts, diagnostic artifacts and private recovery archives are excluded from Git. Hosted sign-in/MFA and draft persistence were verified by the user. Inquiry delivery and site visits remain demos.
